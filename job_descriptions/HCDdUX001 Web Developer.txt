Web Developer - Menlo Park / Palo Alto 

The Human-Centered Design / development team at Theranos is looking for a web developer.  This person must be interested in emerging scientific and technological advancements, understand the concept of triage in web development, and most of all, ready and eager to get neck-deep in a project unlike any other advertised here.  Be prepared to ignore IMs, let your Facebook status stagnate every few days, and not even mind.  We are a group of ex-Apple, Adobe, Macromedia, Sony, Frog, Logitech, Stanford and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati folks who jumped ship from our cushy jobs to be part of something huge, and we're looking for a few more to help us out.



The Role: Web Developer - Menlo Park / Palo Alto 

Do you have a passion for elegant, efficient programming?  What about creating great products that have the potential to be used by millions of people? We're looking for a front-end Web Developer to join our User Experience - HCD/d group. You will be responsible for applying CSS/XHTML, AJAX, and Web 2.0 techniques to Theranos' current and future products.

We are a close-knit, team of product managers, interaction designers, visual interface designers, user researchers, wordsmiths and web developers collaborating closely with hardware and robotics engineering and life science teams.  We're creating innovative, usable, great-looking products that will change the face of healthcare.  This stuff is as sci-fi as it gets.
