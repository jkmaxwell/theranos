### Something something you hung on to confidential data! U thief!

Not really. I had a screenshot of a Theranos thing in my portfolio in 2012 and Theranos sent lawyers after me so deep that we scrubbed all my hard drives of anything even related to Theranos. As far as I knew I had nothing left, which was a real shame.

Years later, after the downfall of Elizabeth and Theranos began, I found a folder called "Theranos" in my Apple iCloud drive. I know why it was there but I have no idea how it did not turn up in our lawyer-assisted searches nor why I hadn't seen it for years. My suspicion is that someone logged back in as me on a computer at Theranos years later and it forced everything to sync back up to my iCloud.

See, Theranos IT was ridiculous. The computers were so locked down and managed that we had no outside email access, no chat access, we couldn't even install our own programs. And the guys who worked there in IT, as much as they wanted to be our buddies, made our lives quite difficult just trying to do our jobs. Being actual normal human beings in product design, we needed to work with contractors, get print work done, stuff that required outside access. And Apple iCloud drive (or whatever dumb name they had for it at the time, like MobileMe or iTools or something) somehow could get our files out of the building to hand off to outside vendors or work on at home.
