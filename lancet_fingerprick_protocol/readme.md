this was the protocol mike and "aaron" wrote to do field research.
elizabeth thought it was useless and thought it didn't matter what the patients thought or
what experience they had. so this was the genesis of my disillusionment. up until this point
elizabeth had treated us all like we were geniuses, but when we had an actual recommendation
she did not like it.

edit: oh right, i forgot! so the big deal here for me was that theranos was using these
lancets that released like a jack in the box. you'd press harder and harder and then your own
pressure against the lancet housing released the pin (term?). these patients weren't 
diabetics so they didn't think of this as a way of life. and stabbing yourself sucks. so we
investigated alternate lancets where patients reported less pain. we found some from a 
british company that had a side trigger. instead of the physical pressure of pressing against
your finger releasing the pin, a trigger on the side, pressed by pinching thumb and forefinger
on the lancet, released it. 

elizabeth was very frustrated that we investigated this and told us it was a waste of time.
